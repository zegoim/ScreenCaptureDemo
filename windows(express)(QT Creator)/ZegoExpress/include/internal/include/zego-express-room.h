 * Logs in to a room with advanced room configurations. You must log in to a room before publishing or playing streams.
 *
 * To prevent the app from being impersonated by a malicious user, you can add authentication before logging in to the room, that is, the [token] parameter in the ZegoRoomConfig object passed in by the [config] parameter.
 * Different users who log in to the same room can get room related notifications in the same room (eg [onRoomUserUpdate], [onRoomStreamUpdate], etc.), and users in one room cannot receive room signaling notifications in another room.
 * Messages sent in one room (e.g. [setStreamExtraInfo], [sendBroadcastMessage], [sendBarrageMessage], [sendCustomCommand], etc.) cannot be received callback ((eg [onRoomStreamExtraInfoUpdate], [onIMRecvBroadcastMessage], [onIMRecvBarrageMessage], [onIMRecvCustomCommand], etc) in other rooms. Currently, SDK does not provide the ability to send messages across rooms. Developers can integrate the SDK of third-party IM to achieve.
 * SDK supports startPlayingStream audio and video streams from different rooms under the same appID, that is, startPlayingStream audio and video streams across rooms. Since ZegoExpressEngine's room related callback notifications are based on the same room, when developers want to startPlayingStream streams across rooms, developers need to maintain related messages and signaling notifications by themselves.
 * If the network is temporarily interrupted due to network quality reasons, the SDK will automatically reconnect internally. You can get the current connection status of the local room by listening to the [onRoomStateUpdate] callback method, and other users in the same room will receive [onRoomUserUpdate] callback notification.
 * It is strongly recommended that userID corresponds to the user ID of the business APP, that is, a userID and a real user are fixed and unique, and should not be passed to the SDK in a random userID. Because the unique and fixed userID allows ZEGO technicians to quickly locate online problems.
 * After the first login failure due to network reasons or the room is disconnected, the default time of SDK reconnection is 20min.
 * For restrictions on the use of this function, please refer to https://doc-en.zego.im/en/6419.html or contact ZEGO technical support.
