 * @param app_sign Application signature for each AppID, please apply from the ZEGO Admin Console. Application signature is a 64 character string. Each character has a range of '0' ~ '9', 'a' ~ 'z'.
 * @param is_test_env Choose to use a test environment or a formal commercial environment, the formal environment needs to submit work order configuration in the ZEGO management console. The test environment is for test development, with a limit of 10 rooms and 50 users. Official environment App is officially launched. ZEGO will provide corresponding server resources according to the configuration records submitted by the developer in the management console. The test environment and the official environment are two sets of environments and cannot be interconnected.
 * @param scenario The application scenario. Developers can choose one of ZegoScenario based on the scenario of the app they are developing, and the engine will preset a more general setting for specific scenarios based on the set scenario. After setting specific scenarios, developers can still call specific functions to set specific parameters if they have customized parameter settings.
